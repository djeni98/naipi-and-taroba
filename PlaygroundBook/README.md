**Legend of Iguazu Falls**

This is a Brazilian indigenous story, from the Kaingang tribe.
It is taught in schools in Paraná, a state of southern Brazil, but it is not well-known even in this region.

> The Kaingang tribe is more numerous in the southern part of Brazil.

In order to spread Brazilian culture and its folklore,
this playground book brings an interactive animation telling this story.
