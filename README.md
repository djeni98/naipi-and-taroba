This is a swift playground book created by Djenifer Renata Pereira and submitted to WWDC21 Swift Challenge. You can see a video preview on [youtube](https://youtu.be/NP4XIpNLOc4).

If you want, you can change to portuguese version by changing the repo branch to **pt-version**.

## About the legend

It is a Brazilian indigenous story, from the Kaingang tribe.
It is taught in schools in Paran치, a state of southern Brazil, but it is not well-known even in this region.

> The Kaingang tribe is more numerous in the southern part of Brazil.

In order to spread Brazilian culture and its folklore,
this playground book brings an interactive animation telling this story.
